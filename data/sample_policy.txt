## Return Policy

We offer a 30-day return policy for all items purchased from our store. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. The item must also be in the original packaging.

To initiate a return:
1. Contact our customer support team via email at support@example.com
2. Provide your order number and reason for return
3. Wait for return authorization and shipping instructions
4. Ship the item back within 14 days of authorization

Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days after we receive the returned item.

## Refund Policy

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within 5-7 business days.

**Late or missing refunds:**
