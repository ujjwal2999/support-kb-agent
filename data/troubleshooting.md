# Troubleshooting

Running into problems? Don't worry, most issues have quick fixes. Here's how to sort out the common ones.

---

## Order didn't go through / No confirmation email

**What's happening:** You placed an order but never got that confirmation email.

**Try this:**
1. Check spam/junk - we end up there more than we'd like
2. Give it 15 minutes, sometimes emails are a bit slow
3. Log into your account and look at "Order History" - if it's there, you're good
4. Nothing showing up? The payment might have failed quietly. Try placing the order again

## Payment got declined

**What's happening:** Your card got rejected at checkout.

**Try this:**
1. Make sure you typed your card number right (happens to everyone)
2. Check that your billing address matches what's on file with your bank
3. Got enough money on the card? Worth checking
4. Your bank might have blocked it - they do that sometimes with online purchases. Give them a quick call
5. If all else fails, try paying a different way

## Promo code isn't working

**What's happening:** You punch in a discount code and it says invalid or just... nothing.

**Try this:**
1. Has it expired? Check the fine print
2. Some codes have minimum purchase amounts
3. Sale items are often excluded (annoying, we know)
4. Make sure you're typing it exactly right - these are usually case-sensitive
5. Also, you can only use one code per order

## Got the wrong item

**What's happening:** What arrived isn't what you ordered.

**Here's what to do:**
1. Grab your phone and take pics of what you got + the shipping label
2. Contact support with your order number and those photos
3. Hang onto the packaging (makes returns smoother)
4. We'll send you a prepaid return label and ship out the right thing

## Something's missing from my order

**What's happening:** You got a package but not everything's in there.

**Here's what to do:**
1. First, check if your order shipped in multiple packages - look for extra tracking emails
2. Look at the packing slip and see what was supposed to be included
3. Hit up support with your order number
4. We'll figure out what happened and either ship the missing stuff or refund you
