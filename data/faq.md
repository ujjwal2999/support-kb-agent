## Orders & Buying Stuff

**How do I place an order?**  
Pretty simple - just browse around, add things to your cart, and hit checkout. You can check out as a guest or make an account if you want faster checkout next time.

**I just placed an order but need to change something. Can I?**  
You've got about an hour after ordering to make changes. After that, it's probably already being processed. If you need to change something, shoot us a message ASAP and we'll see what we can do.

**Where's my order?**  
Once it ships, you'll get an email with a tracking number. You can also check your account under "Order History" to see where things are at.

**What can I pay with?**  
Visa, Mastercard, Amex, PayPal, Apple Pay - we take all the usual stuff.

## Products

**Are these products legit?**  
100%. Everything we sell comes directly from manufacturers or their authorized distributors. No knockoffs, no grey market stuff.

**Is there a warranty?**  
Most things come with the manufacturer's warranty. Check the product page for the specifics - it varies depending on what you're buying.

**My order arrived damaged. Now what?**  
Ugh, sorry about that. Take some photos of the damage and reach out to us within 48 hours. We'll get you a replacement or refund, no extra charge.

## Subscriptions

**How do I cancel my subscription?**  
Go to your account, find "Subscriptions", and hit cancel. You'll still have access until your current billing period ends - we don't cut you off immediately or anything.

**Can I just pause it for a bit?**  
Yep! You can pause for up to 3 months. Just go to account settings and look for "Pause Subscription."

**I need to update my card on file**  
Head to Account Settings → Payment Methods → Update. Easy.
